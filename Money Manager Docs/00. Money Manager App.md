# 💰 Money Manager App – Complete Documentation

This documentation is split into **small, task-focused Markdown files**.  
Each file is designed to be worked on **independently**, reviewed easily, and committed separately.

## 🎯 Product Vision

**Personal Money Manager** – A clean, easy-to-use iOS app for tracking personal expenses with smart recurring bills, custom categories, and monthly budgets.

### Key Principles
- **Personal-focused**: Individual expense tracking, not split between friends
- **Simple first**: MVP complete, expandable later
- **Data-driven**: Clear overview of spending patterns with visual insights
- **Local-first**: On-device storage (Swift Data), future cloud sync

---

## 📱 Platform & Tech

- **Platform**: iOS only (SwiftUI)
- **Data Storage**: Swift Data (local)
- **Future**: Backend server integration for sync
